R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing 
and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[3] The R language 
is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software[4] 
and data analysis.[5] Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature 
databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.[6]
